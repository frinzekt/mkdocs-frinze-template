# Welcome to MkDocs Frinze Template
This is my template that I have created while I was working for a cool company. This is a template that contains extensions that are very nice to have when you just want a standard documentation for anything!

For full documentation visit:

- [mkdocs.org](https://www.mkdocs.org) for the generic MkDocs
- [PyMdown Extensions](https://facelessuser.github.io/pymdown-extensions/) for the different extensions that are installed
- [MkDocs Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) for the customisation of the web server documentation.

## What inspired me to do this?
I have seen that a lot of the documentation is really scattered for Mkdocs. Like the documentation is good and there are a lot of them, but all I really wanted was a generic template with most of the extensions that I will need without being caught up on which one to pick, and so on; so, I ended up creating this which aims to give you a very easy way to start your documentation. In addition, there was some hussle sometimes, in trying to figure out why some extensions aren't working, and it is just frustrating and time-consuming.

Just erase those markdown files in the `/docs` file, and you can get started.

## Installation
Install this preferably in your global environment because this is just a code generator and so.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Commands

* `mkdocs new [dir-name]` - Create a new project.
* `mkdocs serve` - Start the live-reloading docs server.
