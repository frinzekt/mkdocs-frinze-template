How easy is this to deploy? \u00b6 Fork / Clone This Repo Follow the installation Delete the markdown files here and replace it with your own Maybe put your own Nav in the mkdocs.yml file Deploy somewhere ! (easist way Github Pages see here ) What inspired me to do this? \u00b6 I have seen that a lot of the documentation is really scattered for Mkdocs. Like the documentation is good and there are a lot of them, but all I really wanted was a generic template with most of the extensions that I will need without being caught up on which one to pick, and so on; so, I ended up creating this which aims to give you a very easy way to start your documentation. In addition, there was some hussle sometimes, in trying to figure out why some extensions aren't working, and it is just frustrating and time-consuming. Just erase those markdown files in the /docs file, and you can get started.

Collapsible Block \u00b6 More info here If things are getting a little bit crowded, why not make some of them collapsible? Example of a More Complex Documentation Here is the basic idea of bubble sort! 1 2 3 4 5 def bubble_sort ( items ): for i in range ( len ( items )): for j in range ( len ( items ) - 1 - i ): if items [ j ] > items [ j + 1 ]: items [ j ], items [ j + 1 ] = items [ j + 1 ], items [ j ] The Syntax for the Example Above 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ??? Example \"Example of a More Complex Documentation\" Here is the basic idea of bubble sort! ```python def bubble_sort ( items ): for i in range ( len ( items )): for j in range ( len ( items ) - 1 - i ): if items [ j ] > items [ j + 1 ]: items [ j ], items [ j + 1 ] = items [ j + 1 ], items [ j ] ``` Code Highlight \u00b6 This is powered by codehilite. Whenever, you need code, this is the one that makes it pretty. For example: 1 2 3 4 5 def bubble_sort ( items ): for i in range ( len ( items )): for j in range ( len ( items ) - 1 - i ): if items [ j ] > items [ j + 1 ]: items [ j ], items [ j + 1 ] = items [ j + 1 ], items [ j ] Syntax of the Example Above 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ``` python linenums=\"1\" def bubble_sort(items): for i in range(len(items)): for j in range(len(items) - 1 - i): if items[j] > items[j + 1]: items[j], items[j + 1] = items[j + 1], items[j] ``` Highlight Specific Code Lines \u00b6 What if I want to show some cool lines?
